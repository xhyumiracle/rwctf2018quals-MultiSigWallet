blockchain

Hey dud, tell you what, I was learning Solidity and has created a wallet contract for myself to help me manage my HUGE amount of valuable tokens! I've double checked the code, it's handy and secure, nice and cool, I just love it! I'm pretty confident about the fact that no one could ever stolen my token through the wallet, NO ONE!!! You don't believe it? Try it! Hhhhhhhhh...

deploy.js, genesis.json and the contract source code are provided FYI.

It could take about 10-20 seconds for the flag to be delievered after you solved it.
